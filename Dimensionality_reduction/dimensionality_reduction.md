## Dimensionality reduction

- Dimensionality reduction in machine learning refers to the process of reducing the number of input variables (also known as features or dimensions) in a dataset, while preserving as much relevant information as possible.

- Dimensionality reduction simplifies data without losing key information. 

- It's essential for: Better generalization, Reduced noise, Improved model performance, Visualization

#### Why is Dimensionality Reduction Needed?

- **Curse of dimensionality**: High-dimensional data can be sparse and harder to model effectively.

- **Overfitting**: More features can mean more chances to fit noise instead of signal.

- **Computational efficiency**: Fewer features = faster training and inference.

- **Data visualization**: Reducing to 2 or 3 dimensions allows you to visualize complex datasets.

##### What is Curse of dimensionality ?

- The curse of dimensionality refers to various problems that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (i.e., with many features)

- As the number of dimensions increases, the data becomes harder to work with, and many machine learning algorithms become less effective or more computationally expensive.
